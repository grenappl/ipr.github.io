        <p>
            Number systems are the frameworks of mathematics which are used to represent, categorize, and perform operations on numbers. They play an important role in arithmetic and logical calculations for various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and engineering. A number system is purely defined by its base, which indicates the number of unique digits, including zero, that can be used in its system. The most common number systems used include the decimal number system or base 10, binary number system or base 2, octal number system or base 8, and hexadecimal number system or base 16. The decimal system, which uses digits 0–9, is the most known and widely used system in everyday life as it aligns with regular counting and it is an essential part of human activities like financial transactions, general arithmetic, and many more mathematical situations. The binary system is a fundamental part of computing and digital electronics. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, which correspond to two different states with 0 being off/false and 1 being on/true. It is an ideal number system for computers because it processes data in binary code which computers are capable of reading and analyzing. The octal system, which uses digits 0–7 and is still a fundamental part of computing like binary, provides a more compact way of representing binary numbers because three binary digits correspond to one octal digit. Although octal is actually less common today, it is used for aviation systems, file permissions, and education and research purposes. The hexadecimal system, which is actually an extension of the decimal number system, using digits 0–9 and letters A–F with each letter representing the decimal numbers 10-15 respectively, is widely used in computing and digital designing, similar to the use cases of binary and octal. It is commonly used to represent color codes, memory addresses, and large binary numbers since four binary digits correspond to one hexadecimal digit. Each of these number systems has its own significance and applications. To summarize, decimal numbers are crucial for everyday human activities, and binary, octal, and hexadecimal have important roles in ensuring the functionality of digital technology, with each number system providing efficient ways to handle, represent, and process information in electronic systems. It is also important to note that mastering the different number systems is essential for understanding both the theoretical concepts in mathematics and practical applications in digital technology.
