        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Computers, as we know from the modern age, are electronic devices that can take input from users, process that information according to user input and set programming instructions, produce an output and store that information for the user to potentially use in the future. There are different types of computers that provide different uses, ranging from supercomputers that perform trillions of calculations per second to microcomputers that fit in the palm of your hand. This study aims to compare and contrast different types of computers in terms of their specifications, capabilities, and appropriate applications.</p>

                    <li><i>Supercomputers</i></li>
                    <p>Supercomputers are one of the most complicated type of computers, used for computing highly complex calculations like weather forecasting, scientific simulations and cryptography. They contain multiple CPUs, wide memory, and have fast processing rates. These devices consume high amounts of energy but are needed for some of the most processing-intensive work applications.</p>

                    <li><i>Mainframe Computers</i></li>
                    <p>Mainframe computers are large and powerful systems that are mainly used by large organizations for bulk data processing, transaction handling, and database management. They are less powerful than supercomputers but are optimized for reliability, scalability, and handling thousands of users simultaneously.</p>

                    <p>Mini computers, also known as mid-range computers, are mid-process power systems that are smaller than mainframes with a balance of processing and size. They are widely used for manufacturing processes in various research laboratories and servers for medium-sized organizations.</p>

                    <p>Workstations are high-performance desktop computers used primarily by professionals for graphic design, CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing), video editing, software development, and other operations and more complex applications. Advanced graphics capabilities, powerful CPUs, and the design for multitasking and heavy-duty applications are its most common characteristics.</p>
