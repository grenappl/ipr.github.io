            <p>It is an academic discipline and systematic study that involves algorithmic and computational processes. It was derived from other computing-related fields like computer engineering and mathematics with history playing a significant part in its development. The fundamental question, which goes for all of computing, is figuring out what can be efficiently automated</p>

                <li>Computing was introduced thousands of years ago with evidence of it starting from counting and calculation. Early civilizations developed ways of processing storing numerical information like the Quipu and Chinese counting rods</li>
                <li>Computer science was one of the most important disciplines in the past half-century with the inclusion of related fields such as information systems and software engineering</li> 
                <li>During 1940-1950, a market for books and articles for explaining electronics was produced from the creation of the first experimental and programmable electronic computers and its produced models</li>
                <li>In late 1970, a few key institutions that helped in shaping the history of computing include the journal IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Charles Babbage Institute, and Computer History Museum</li>

        <p>
            Computing has definitely grown over the past years, especially computer science as a discipline. Multiple businesses and organizations utilize the science of computing as it helps with their everyday needs and makes different processes and occasions that would be difficult so much easier with computation. algorithms, and the computer system as a whole. Today, computer science has grown to be one of the most influential disciplines in the modern world due to how society relies on its efficiency and problem-solving capabilities and it has only gotten bigger and better. In the past, even computing was present, but it was still in its development stages and concepts like mathematics and mechanical devices have helped push computing to grow and lead people to discover more advanced computing systems. Some discoveries that pushed computer science forward include the Turning Machine by Alan Turing, the Von Neumann Architecture by John von Neumann, and the Analytical Engine, first proposed and worked on by Charles Babbage and finished by Ada Lovelace. There were many others who have discovered or contributed towards computer science, but nevertheless, their contributions have shaped the modern computing world and it has grown ever since.
            <br><br>
            Computer Science isn’t the only discipline from computing, as it has come from other disciplines before it came to fruition. To list 5 of the major computing disciplines, these include Computing Engineering, Computer Science. Information Systems, Information Technology, and Software Engineering. Each of these disciplines are computer related but they all differ on what areas and expertise they cover. To put it simply, computer engineering works on both hardware and software components, computer science leans towards software, information systems is more on the business aspect, information technology is focused on organizational needs, and software engineering leads towards software but is less broad compared to computer science. Although these disciplines are different, they do have importance in their own ways and are similar to one another with all of them belonging to the category of computing. Depending on the educational course you choose or the profession you decide to be, as long as it’s computer related, it's important to realize that the 5 major computing disciplines will come in handy and focusing on learning and developing one of these disciplines should help with your computing-related course or career.
