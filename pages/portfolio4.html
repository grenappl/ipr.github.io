        <p>
            Computer hardware and software both play significant roles in modern society when it comes to providing goods and services for different purposes to citizens through the use of technology in various institutions in the community. To differentiate computer hardware and software once again but in a shorter manner, hardware consists of the physical components of a computer system, which includes the processors, memory, storage devices and input/output devices, while software consists of a set of instructions or programs that allow the components of hardware to function. Both hardware and software can be separated into different categories, with hardware having internal and external components, and software being either application-based or system-based. These internal hardware components include the motherboard, random access memory, central processing unit, power supply unit, heat sink, and hard disk drive/solid state drive, and external hardware components include the monitor/screen, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, printer, and joystick. Types of application software include general purpose software, customized software, and utility software, and system software types are the operating system, language processor, and device driver. Together, they form the computer system to serve the educational and healthcare institutions and business and government sectors.

            In educational institutions, cloud computing has been a prominent way for educational materials and learnings to be shared and repurposed, even after COVID-19. Students have the ability to learn through educational software, online assessments, and remote learning platforms. This implies that access to information is expanded, and education quality has improved, besides the fact that students learn in a collaborative and innovative environment. In healthcare institutions, computer hardware and software have assisted with patient care and the efficiency of operations. Specific hardware such as diagnostic machines and electronic health record systems in hospitals and clinics collect, store, and analyze the patient data. Specific medical software applications enable healthcare professionals to gain access and manage it in real-time for a proper diagnosis and treatment while tracking the patient. In business sectors, the combination of hardware and software has massively increased productivity and decision-making processes. Computer hardware such as servers and desktop stations combined with the appropriate financial and data analysis software help companies achieve a greater understanding of technology and successful business growth. Government sectors also heavily depend on computer systems to manage large datasets with regards to public services. The hardware infrastructure of the government system would include data servers and secured networks, while the software applications would be database management systems and cybersecurity tools. Regarding public services, citizens have been enabled to access important details, pay taxes, or apply for permits online without a need for direct interaction through the use of online portals. This use of technology has made governance more efficient because it can be used by citizens and updated on a daily basis.
