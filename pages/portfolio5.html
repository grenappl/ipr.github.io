        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The motherboard is a circuit board that essentially connects all components of a computer together and allows those components to communicate with each other. The design, size, and features of a motherboard significantly impact the capabilities, expansion options, and compatibility of a system. The development of the motherboard is very unique and has an impact on the market compared to other hardware devices because of how its development would affect these other devices depending on their compatibility with each other. There are different types of motherboards that have various uses such as standard desktop use, high-end gaming or industrial systems. This study will cover the key differences among several types of motherboards based on factors such as form factor, build, CPU and memory slots, chipset compatibility, BIOS features, PCI slots, SATA ports, and built-in features.</p>

            <p>Motherboards can be categorized into several types, mainly based on form factors which define its physical dimensions and layout. Form factors also impact other parts like the number of components that can be connected, expansion capabilities, cooling requirements, and power consumption. Each type of motherboard is specialized for a specific set of use cases.</p>

                    <li><i>AT Motherboard (Advanced Technology)</i></li>
                    <p>One of the earliest types of motherboards, developed and popularized in the late 20th century. It is characterized by its large size which limits its use in compact cases. It typically supports older processors and expansion slots, making it mostly irrelevant today.</p>

                <div>
                    <li><i>ATX Motherboard (Advanced Technology eXtended)</i></li>
                    <p>The most common form factor today, offering a balance between size and expansion capability. It is used in a wide range of systems from basic desktop setups to high-performance gaming PCs.</p>
