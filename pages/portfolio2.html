            Data and information are components in computing that are essential to allow information systems to happen. Although both are different, they work in unison wherein data is required for information to be consumed while information is also required for data to be processed, contextualized, and used appropriately. In today's world, businesses and organizations rely heavily on data and information for a multitude of processes like decision-making, strategic planning, and managing. These processes have become easily more complete with the use of information systems, having the ability to transform a vast amount of raw data into meaningful information, which has become a necessity for modern day business operations and organizations. Information systems have allowed for data to be processed more efficiently into digestible information with a multitude of businesses and organizations using these systems to operate.
            <br><br>
            Information Systems (IS) serve to fill the gap between technology and business processes of modern day business operations. With technology being prominent in todayâ€™s age of technology, businesses need information systems to survive and thrive in the modern era. By utilizing technology with business practices, it greatly improves the quality of the business by enhancing productivity, assisting in decision making, allowing faster communication between managers, employees, and consumers, and giving an overall advantage over competitors. Within information systems exist support systems that are specialized to support business operations through various business-related tasks. To briefly name and summarize these support systems, Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) are used to make the process of day-to-day transactions very efficient, Management Information Systems (MIS) focus on providing management comprehensive reports on business operations to assist in the decision-making process, Decision Support Systems (DSS) help managers make informed decisions by providing access to relevant data and analytics from the business, and Executive Information Systems (EIS) offer top-level executives quick access to critical information which influence strategic and tactical decision-making. These systems not only enhance decision-making but they also make sure that the data and information being provided flows smoothly across different levels of the organization. Each type of support system is tailored to specific roles within an organization, showing the versatility and importance of information systems in a modern day business. Without the implementation of information systems and support systems, many businesses and organizations would fail to grow and expand and would most likely not see success due to mismanagement, lack of data efficiency and poor customer service.
